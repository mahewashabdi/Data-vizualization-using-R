## Introduction
This report presents a study of the Irish election 2020 for the region Galway West and compares it with 2016 elections. It summarizes:  
- The vote per party in each election.  
- The change in votes per party from 2016-2020  
- A comparison to the national average for party share of the vote  
- The change in vote for the most significant candidates in both elections

## Data wrangling

##Read data of year 2020 for Galway West and choosing Party, candidate ,FPV and count1 columns for the total no. of votes
data1 <- read_xlsx('GalwayWest-2020.xlsx',range = cell_cols("B:E"), col_names = c("Party","Candidate","FPv%","count1"))
data2020 <- data1[-1,] ## removing the extra row that has heading
data2020
 ## Read data of year 2016 for Galway
data2 <- read.csv('2016-04-28_general-election-count-details-galway-west-csv_en.csv')
## filtering the rows with count1 and selecting the candidate, total.votes and Party columns and concatenating the candidate name from first name and surname.
## The FPV votes are considered which are obtained by filtering with the value where count = 1
data_16 <- data2 %>% filter(Count.Number==1) %>% select("Candidate.surname","Candidate.First.Name","Total.Votes","Party" ) %>% mutate(Candidate = paste(Candidate.First.Name,Candidate.surname,sep=" "),count1=Total.Votes) %>% select(Party,Candidate,count1)

## Correcting the party labels in 2016 wrt to 2020 voting dataset
data_16$Party[which(data_16$Party=="Fine  Gael")] <- "Fine Gael"
data_16$Party[which(data_16$Party=="Social Democratic Party")] <- "Social Democrats"
data_16$Party[which(data_16$Party=="Fianna Fail")] <- "Fianna Fáil"
data_16$Party[which(data_16$Party=="Ind")] <- "Independent"
data_16$Party[which(data_16$Party=="Sinn Fein")] <- "Sinn Féin"
data_16$Party[which(data_16$Party=="AAA")] <- "Solidarity–PBP"
data_16
```
## 1) Calculation of vote per party in each election

```{r include=FALSE}
## Summarizing the 2020 and 2016 data by calculating the total sum of vote counts (FPV is considered) for each party
vote_16 <- data_16 %>% group_by(Party) %>% summarise("2016" = sum(count1))
vote_20 <- data2020 %>% group_by(Party) %>% summarise("2020" = sum(as.numeric(count1)))
## For 2016 and 2020, FPV votes are combined for each party 
vote_party <- full_join(vote_16,vote_20)
```


```{r include=FALSE}
## Joining the datasets for both the years 2016 and 2020 for Galway west
combined_result <- full_join(vote_16,vote_20)
combined_result

```
## Plot vote per party in each election
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
## Changing the format of the tibble to use it for plot by using pivot_longer
## Okabi and Ito's palette has been used in the plot
 untidy_data <- combined_result %>%
  pivot_longer(!Party, names_to = "Year", values_to = "count")
untidy_data
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
theme_set(theme_classic())

                     breaks = c( 2500,  5000,  7500, 10000, 12500,15000 )) +

  ## Colors are chosen from Okabi and Ito's paletter
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#cc79a7","#0072b2" ), name = NULL) +

```
## CVD view of the plot 1
```{r}
cvd <- cvd_grid(plot1)
cvd
ggsave("cvd.png", plot = cvd)
```


## Design decisions

- The labels of the parties are different in 2016 as compared to 2020 dataset. The labels are corrected like Ind -> Independent. Also party like AAA was de-registered and renamed to Solidarity-PBP in 2020, so AAA has been changed in the dataset of 2016.
- The grid lines are colored white to make it easier to read the vertical line which is indicative of count of votes.
-  The y axis title has been removed as the plot title is already provided to avoid redundancy.
-  The bar plot with position as dodge has been used to compare the counts in 2016 and 2020.
-  Colors from Okabi and Ito's palette has been used for CVD readers.

## 2) The change in vote per party from 2016-2020 for Galway West

```{r include=FALSE}
combined_result[is.na(combined_result)] <- 0
change <- combined_result %>% select("Party" ,"2016"  ,"2020" ) %>% mutate( diff = combined_result[[3]]-combined_result[[2]])
# response has been created to show whether difference is positive or negative. This will allow us to map as an aesthetic to the values of the "response'. 
change$response <- factor(ifelse(change$diff >= 0, "Positive", "Negative"), levels= c("Positive","Negative"))
change

```



```{r}
## Plot for the change in vote from 2016-2020 per party

#Produce a plot which uses party as x-axis, diff_in_votes as y and fills by party for easily comparison

## 2 colors have been defined to show the positive and negative change.

color <- c("#7997FF","#F8766D")

    labels = seq(-5e3, 5e3, by = 1e3),
    name = "Difference in votes per party"
  )+ scale_fill_manual(values=color) + 
  theme(
    axis.line.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
    axis.line.x = element_blank(),
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),

      colour = "lightgrey"
    ),
    panel.ontop = TRUE,
    legend.position = "none",
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0)
    
  ) +
  #Add a horizontal line at the origin to differentiate between positive and negative values
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0,
             size = 0.1,
             colour = "grey")


```
## Design Decisions

- The Party names are shown on the y-axis to enhance the readability of the reader.
- The title of the y - axis for the party is removed as it is already shown in the title that we are showing the change in vote per party.
- The bar chart uses a subtle color to show the sensitive coding scheme.

## Design Decisions

• The % share of vote has been considered to show comparison since the count of the Galway west will always be lower as compared to national average count so the percentage of the total votes has been taken into account.
• The names of the Party are reflected on the y-axis to enhance readability for the reader.
• The % vote share has been shown on the right side of the bar to enhance readability.
• To reduce redundancy, x-axis title has been removed since the labels for the % vote has been provided on the bar itself.
•	The few of the party names are combined under one name such as “Independent 4 change” and “Independents” are considered as “Independent”.


4) Change in vote for the most significant candidates in both elections in Galway West

The most significant candidates will be the one which participated in both the elections of 2016 and 2020. The most significant candidates are selected from each party based on the one which performed best in the 2020 elections.

    legend.key.size = unit(0.7, "lines"),
    legend.title = element_blank())# legend keys were a little large)
 
```



##Design Decisions

1)Some of the Candidate names are changed so that they have same spelling names.
2)The candidates with the FPV are considered for the plot.
3)The names of the candidates are reflected on the y-axis to enhance readability for the reader. 


• The most significant candidates will be the one which participated in both the elections of 2016 and 2020.
• The most significant candidates are selected from each party based on the one which performed best in the 2020 elections.
• The names of the candidates appear on the y-axis to enhance readability for the reader.
• The dots are used to compare the performance for year 2020 and 2016.

## Conclusion
•	The 3 major parties came out from the comparison of the results were Fine Gael, Fianna Fail and Sinn Fein
•	The performances of Sinn Fein and Green party have improved whereas for Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have declined in year 2020 for Galway West.
•	Sinn Fein performance is better nationally as compared to Galway West.
•	Noel Grealish showed the best performance in the year 2016 and 2020 whereas Eamon O Cuiv performance declined in the election of 2020.
